  sha: ''  # Use the sha or tag you want to point at
  hooks:
    - id: prettier
      args: [] #list of args like '--single-quote', '--jsx-bracket-same-line', '--print-width 120', '--no-bracket-spacing'
      additional_dependencies: ['prettier@1.1.0']
 ```          
 
  ### FAQ's
  
  **1.** Why does pre-commit say failed everytime prettier changes the file.
  
  **A.** This is how pre-commit works. You need to just add the files again and commit. This is done so that you can verify the changes.
